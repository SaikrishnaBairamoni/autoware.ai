## Autoware
[![Autoware](https://www.autoware.ai/static/img/autoware_web_img.png)](https://www.autoware.ai)

[Autoware](https://www.autoware.ai) is the world's first "all-in-one" open-source software for self-driving vehicles. The capabilities of Autoware are primarily well-suited for urban cities, but highways, freeways, mesomountaineous regions, and geofenced areas can be also covered. The code base of Autoware is protected by the Apache 2 License. Please use it at your own discretion. For safe use, we provide a ROSBAG-based simulation environment for those who do not own real autonomous vehicles. If you plan to use Autoware with real autonomous vehicles, **please formulate safety measures and assessment of risk before field testing.**

You may refer to [Autoware Wiki](https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/wiki) for **Users Guide** and **Developers Guide**.

## What Is Autoware

[![Autoware Overview](docs/images/autoware_overview.png)](https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/wiki/Overview)

Autoware provides a rich set of self-driving modules composed of sensing, computing, and actuation capabilities. An overview of those capabilities is described [here](https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/wiki/Overview). Keywords include *Localization, Mapping, Object Detection & Tracking, Traffic Light Recognition, Mission & Motion Planning, Trajectory Generation, Lane Detection & Selection, Vehicle Control, Sensor Fusion, Cameras, LiDARs, RADARs, Deep Learning, Rule-based System, Connected Navigation, Logging, Virtual Reality, and so on*.

## Cloud Services

### Autoware Online

You may test Autoware at [Autoware Online](http://autoware.online/). No need to install the Autoware repository to your local environment.

### Automan

You may annotate and train your ROSBAG data using your web browser through [Automan](https://www.automan.ai). The trained models can be used for deep neural network algorithms in Autoware, such as SSD and Yolo.

### ROSBAG STORE

You may download a number of test and simulation data sets from Tier IV's [ROSBAG STORE](https://rosbag.tier4.jp). Note that free accounts would not allow you to access image data due to privacy matters. 

### Map Tools

You may create 3D map data through Tier IV's [Map Tools](https://maptools.tier4.jp/). The 3D map data used in Autoware are composed of point cloud structure data and vector feature data.
